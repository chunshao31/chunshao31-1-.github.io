      <p>The <strong>Barrett M82</strong> is a "Special Application Scoped Rifle" (SASR) developed and produced by the American Barrett Firearms Company. The gun and its derivatives Most of the armies of Western countries, including the US military. The US military nicknamed it "Light Fifty" because it uses the same 12.7×99 mm NATO (.50 BMG, 12.7 mm) large-caliber ammunition as the Browning M2 heavy machine gun. The gun has many derivatives, including the original M82, M82A1, M82A3 and the M82A2, which uses a bullpup design for easy portability. The subsequent XM500 also inherited its design spirit and used a bullpup design. The improved version adopted by the US military is named "M107" (the top of the upper receiver is equipped with a full-size Picatinny rail), and the latest model currently launched by Barrett is a further improved version of the M107, M107A1.</p>
