            <h2>How to use firearms</h2><hr>
            <p id="no">Please note that when using firearms, you must <b>comply with national and regional laws and regulations and receive professional training.</b> Firearms require extreme caution and responsibility, ensuring safety measures and operating procedures at all times.</p><br><br>
            
            <p>The use of firearms is an act that requires rigorous operation and a high sense of responsibility. Individuals who have been trained and authorized are prohibited from using firearms. The following are the basic instructions for using firearms. The first step is to provide correct operating instructions to the right people.</p><hr>
            <h5>Step 1: Learn the construction and assembly of firearms</h5><br>
            <p>Before using a firearm, you need to learn the structure of the gun handle and the names and functions of each component. You can consult the manual of the firearm or attend a firearms usage course to learn about the assembly and disassembly process of the gun in order to clean and maintain the gun.</p><hr>
            <h5>Step 2: Buy the right bullets</h5><br>
            <p>Each gun has a suitable bullet specification, never use the wrong bullet. Make sure the bullets you purchase match your inspection equipment, and carefully read the instructions for using the bullets.</p><hr>
            <h5>Step 3: Hold the inspection tool correctly</h5><br>
            <p>The correct grip is to use the catch chain. When holding the firearm, place the index finger of the main hand above the trigger, and place the index finger of the non-main hand on the front of the catch. Make sure your grip is stable and firm to prevent the firearm from misfiring or losing control.</p><hr>
            <h5>Step 4: Safe operation and inspection of equipment</h5><br>
            <p>Before operating a firearm, always make sure the firearm is safe, i.e. unloaded, and never operate the firearm without safety equipment or instructions. When operating a firearm, always point the muzzle in a safe direction and away from any possible person or object</p><hr>
            <h5>Step 5: Load bullets correctly</h5><br>
            <p>After confirming safety, load the bullets correctly and follow the instructions of the firearm manual or instructor to load the bullets into the bullet. , always keep in mind the correct steps for loading bullets, and do not endanger yourself by being hasty.</p><hr>
            <h5>Step 6: Accurate target</h5><br>
            <p>Before shooting, use the mechanical tool or optical sight of the firearm to accurately aim at the target, and ensure that the bullet hits the target through the aiming capacity of the entire firearm.</p><hr>
            <h5>Step 7: Ready to shoot, pay attention to breathing and alarm control</h5><br>
            <p>When preparing to shoot, keep breathing steadily and pull the trigger slowly and evenly. Do not pull the trigger quickly or violently, so as not to cause the bullet to miss the target and affect the shooting effect.</p><br>

            <h5>Detailed shooting steps are as follows:</h5><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Check the status of the gun to make sure it is not loaded and not jammed or damaged.</li>
                <li>Hold the gun: Hold the gun handle with your main hand, with your fingers straight and placed on the outside of the trigger. Grasp the stock with your support hand to provide support.</li>
                <li>Aim at the target: Aim the muzzle at the target, keep your eyes on the sight, and adjust your posture to obtain accurate aiming.</li>
                <li>Load the bullet Insert the bullet into the bullet or rifling of the barrel and make sure the bullet is loaded correctly.</li>
                <li>Remove the safety: Depending on the gun model, it may be necessary to move the safety from the "safe" position to the "fire" position.</li>
                <li>Pull the trigger: Pull the trigger with even pressure so that it contacts the trigger ring and fires the bullet emission.</li>
                <li>Recoil control: Recoil will be generated when the gun is fired. Pay attention to controlling the rise of the muzzle to maintain target aim.</li>
                <li>Repeated shooting: If you need to shoot multiple times, you can repeat operations such as loading, aiming, and triggering the alarm.</li>
            </ol><br><hr>
            <h5>Step 8: Pay attention to post-shooting processing</h5><br>
            <p>After the shooting is over, keep your finger away from the trigger and stay on the police field. Point the firearm in a safe direction, make sure there are no bullets left, remove the rebound in time, and check and clean the firearm.</p><hr>
